## My Journey into Technology 💻

I entered the world of computers when I was 13 years old as a café attendant at <a href="https://pilipinas.worldorgs.com/Katalogo/bayan-ng-maco/serbisyo-sa-computer/clark-cyber-cafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark Cyber Cafe</a>. Being curious about programming, I stumbled upon how to automate PC shutdown and power on using **CMD**. This simple discovery sparked my passion for technology and automation.

For almost a year, I worked at the cyber café, learning and experimenting with computers whenever I could. This hands-on experience gave me invaluable exposure to technology and fueled my desire to learn more.

## Building the Foundation 🔧

After my time at the cyber café, I pursued formal education in **Computer Hardware and Servicing (CHS)** at <a href="https://phl.bizdirlib.com/node/134481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maco Vocational School</a> and became an **NCII passer**. This certification gave me a solid understanding of computer systems and hardware, which would prove essential in my future development work.

I then enrolled in a **Computer Science course at University of Mindanao, Tagum Campus**. There, I started learning web development, **Java**, and some **C#**. I was excited to dive deeper into programming and build real applications.

## Pandemic & Self-Learning 🏠

But then the pandemic struck. Like many students, I had to adapt to learning from home. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I discovered **FreeCodeCamp.org**. Through this platform, I learned extensively about **frontend development**, mastering **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The structured curriculum and hands-on projects helped me build a strong foundation in web development.

## Professional Training 🎓

From **August 2022 to January 2023**, I completed a **Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp from KodeGo**. This intensive program equipped me with modern development practices and full-stack capabilities, covering both frontend and backend technologies. The bootcamp was a turning point in my career, giving me the skills and confidence to work as a professional developer.

## Professional Experience 💼

Since completing my bootcamp, I've worked with various companies and clients:

- **Onlinejobs.ph** (Aug 2023 - Present) - Software Developer, building real-time communication systems using Flask, WebRTC, and WebSockets
- **Udemy** (Jun-Aug 2023) - Web Development Instructor, creating comprehensive courses for aspiring developers
- **Purple Roof** (March-May 2023) - Junior Frontend Developer, contributing to mortgage solutions platform
- **Rooche Digital** (Dec 2022 - Mar 2023) - Backend Python Developer, developing and maintaining APIs for ecommerce clients

## What Drives Me 🚀

I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions and continuously learning new technologies. Whether it's building APIs, crafting user interfaces, or solving complex problems, I love the challenge of turning ideas into reality.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
